Project Title: Simple Memory UVM Environment                                                 
The project completion date is September 11, 2023.

Description:
The Simple Memory UVM Environment, developed by Kareem, is a comprehensive Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) environment designed to verify the functionality of 
a basic memory module. This environment provides a robust framework for testing the read and write operations of the memory, ensuring its reliability and correctness.

Key Features:
1. UVM Compliance: The environment follows the UVM methodology, allowing seamless integration with existing UVM-based verification environments.
2. Read and Write Verification: The environment facilitates thorough testing of read and write operations, ensuring accurate data retrieval and storage within the memory module.
3. Random Stimulus Generation: Random stimulus generation enables comprehensive testing scenarios, covering various read and write patterns to uncover potential corner cases.
4. Coverage Collection: The environment collects coverage metrics to assess the effectiveness of the test suite and identify any untested areas for further refinement.
5. Reusability and Extendability: The environment is designed to be modular and easily extensible, promoting code reuse and simplifying future enhancements or modifications.
6. Compatibility: The environment is compatible with widely used simulation tools, making it adaptable to diverse verification environments.
